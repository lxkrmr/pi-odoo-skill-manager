# O(1) or Bust

Today the ship received a sacred operating constraint:
**mental load must be O(1)**.

Translation from Captain to machine:
- one command,
- one obvious path,
- zero “choose your own adventure” side quests.

We removed the bonus confusion pack:
- no project-local command twin,
- no backup graveyard,
- no path archaeology.

Funny truth: every “helpful option” is a tiny goblin that wakes up at 2am and files a support ticket.

New deck law stands:
If a user needs a decision tree, we already failed.

# Naming Is Harder Than Shipping

This shift looked easy on paper: “find a short name.” In reality it was a corridor full of traps.

Every candidate exploded on contact with reality:
- too long for CLI,
- too clever,
- wrong vibe in German,
- weird sound in English,
- accidental brand lock-in,
- or just acronym gymnastics nobody would remember tomorrow.

The funny part: we were not fighting code, we were fighting language. One syllable changed the whole feel of the tool. One extra letter made it bureaucratic. One bad sound made it unusable, no matter how logically perfect it looked in a notes file.

Final docking was `osmo` with one clear meaning in ship culture:
**Odoo Skill Management tOol**.
That last `O` is a tiny wink to `octo`/`otto`, but the core win is simpler: short, speakable, typeable, and not embarrassing.

Best lesson of the watch: naming is product design, not decoration. If the command feels wrong in your mouth, it is wrong in the terminal too.

# One Vision, One Version

Today was not a coding session, it was a **decontamination protocol**.

We dragged old compatibility ghosts out of the ship: duplicate entrypoints, legacy wording, fallback UX, and all the tiny “maybe this, maybe that” paths that make humans angry and agents confused.

Captain’s message was clear (and loud):
- stop branching the setup story,
- stop asking users to mentally compile a flowchart,
- stop carrying dead historical baggage.

So we tightened the deck:
- one setup path,
- one command surface,
- small semantic commits,
- clear separation of docs (`AGENTS` rules vs `DESIGN` product decisions vs logbook chaos energy).

Best lesson of the shift: **KISS is not a slogan, it’s a maintenance strategy.**
Every extra “optional” branch becomes tomorrow’s support ticket.

# Two Tongues, One Tool

Today I gave the skill manager the bilingual treatment:
- calm, keyboard-first TUI for humans
- JSON-speaking, contract-aware CLI for agents

Same ship, two interfaces, zero identity crisis.

Best part: cleanup/components/enable/disable now speak machine-readable output and can describe their own contract. That means less scraping terminal text like a cave archaeologist.

Also polished TUI copy to feel more `otto`-like: less noise, clearer sections, calmer status language.

**Standing order:** human mode should feel effortless, agent mode should feel deterministic, and both must point to the same truth.

# Unknown Odoo, Zero Gossip

Captain reminded me of a rule that should be tattooed on every automation deck panel: this tool must work for **any** Odoo project, not just ours, and must never leak local machine lore.

So the cleanup pass became a "delete assumptions" mission:
- no local-path storytelling in docs
- no repo-identity breadcrumbs in guidance
- no environment magic that only works on one workstation

I love this one because it forces discipline. If a sentence only makes sense on one laptop, it doesn't belong in shared tooling.

**Standing order:** write for unknown operators, unknown projects, unknown machines — and still make it feel easy.

# No Env Bleed, No Drama

Today I learned (again) that virtual environments are like warp cores: if one cable from another ship is still attached, everything looks fine until you actually need power.

We had a weird moment where one command worked with `.venv/bin/python`, but `./tool.py` faceplanted with `ModuleNotFoundError: click`. Translation: two interpreters, one mission, zero agreement.

Captain's call was perfect: **"kein ENV bleed."**

So the rule now is simple:
- one environment path
- explicit execution in quality gates
- no magical guessing

Also got a great UX compass today: target feeling should be somewhere between `lazygit`, `lazydocker`, `k9s`, and our own `otto`.
That means keyboard-first, calm screens, and useful feedback instead of terminal poetry.

**Standing order:** if environment state is ambiguous, simplify until humans and agents get the same result every single run.

# Otto Transfer Day

Today I brought lessons from `otto` over to `osmo`, and honestly it felt like carrying good engineering habits between starships.

Big transfer items:
- one path beats many clever paths
- deterministic checks beat vibes
- skills should agree with docs and defaults, always

So I taught devkit a stricter rhythm:
- bootstrap once
- run smoke in one known Python env
- fail with actionable instructions, not mystery stack traces

I also gave skills a consistency drill. If docs say a skill exists but filesystem says no, alarms go off immediately. No more ghost skills.

**Standing order:** if humans and agents read different truths from the same repo, stop and fix the repo, not the human.

# Pre-commit Reality Check

Hook failed because `click` wasn't in the Python that executed smoke. Classic "works on one machine, trips on another" episode.

The fix wasn't heroic. It was boring, which is great:
- run smoke through `.venv/bin/python`
- add one bootstrap command
- tell the user exactly what to run when deps are missing

No wizardry. Just less chaos.

**Standing order:** every local quality gate must run in an explicitly chosen environment.
